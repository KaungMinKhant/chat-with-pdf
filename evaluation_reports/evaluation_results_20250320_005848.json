      "response": "The key findings from Rajkumar's paper on evaluating the Text-to-SQL capabilities of large language models include:\n\n1. **Performance Comparison**: The study found that generative language models trained on code, such as Codex, provide a strong baseline for Text-to-SQL tasks. Codex outperformed a T5-3B model fine-tuned on the same examples in few-shot settings, particularly on the GeoQuery dataset.\n\n2. **Few-shot Learning**: The paper demonstrated that prompt-based few-shot learning significantly enhances the performance of models like Codex, especially when provided with a limited number of examples (5 or 10-shot settings).\n\n3. **Failure Modes Analysis**: The authors analyzed the failure modes of these models, which can guide future prompt design, whether through few-shot examples or natural language instructions.\n\n4. **Evaluation on Spider and Spider-Realistic**: The models were evaluated on the Spider dataset and a modified version called Spider-Realistic, which removes explicit column name references. The performance drop on Spider-Realistic was expected due to its increased difficulty, indicating that memorization alone could not account for the observed performance.\n\n5. **SQL Execution Accuracy**: The paper reported various metrics such as valid/executable SQL accuracy, execution accuracy, and test-suite accuracy, highlighting the models' strengths and weaknesses in generating correct SQL queries.\n\nOverall, the findings suggest that while large language models show promise in Text-to-SQL tasks, there are still challenges and areas for improvement, particularly in handling more complex queries and maintaining accuracy without relying on memorization.",

      "response": "Text-to-SQL models are evaluated using several metrics, each with its own strengths and limitations. Here are some commonly used metrics:\n\n1. **Execution Accuracy**: This measures the percentage of generated SQL queries that execute successfully and return the correct results. It is a direct measure of the model's ability to produce valid SQL queries that fulfill the user's request.\n\n   - **Limitations**: Execution accuracy can be sensitive to the specific database state and the data it contains. A query might be syntactically correct but semantically incorrect if the underlying data does not match the user's intent.\n\n2. **Validity of SQL (V A)**: This metric assesses whether the generated SQL queries are valid according to SQL syntax rules.\n\n   - **Limitations**: A valid SQL query may not necessarily produce the correct results. Thus, this metric does not guarantee that the query meets the user's requirements.\n\n3. **F1 Score**: This is often used to evaluate the overlap between the predicted SQL queries and the ground truth queries, focusing on precision and recall.\n\n   - **Limitations**: The F1 score may not capture the semantic correctness of the SQL queries, as it primarily focuses on syntactic similarity.\n\n4. **ROUGE Scores**: These metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L) evaluate the overlap of n-grams between the predicted and reference SQL queries.\n\n   - **Limitations**: ROUGE scores are primarily syntactic and may not reflect the semantic correctness of the SQL queries. They can be influenced by the specific phrasing of the queries rather than their logical correctness.\n\n5. **BERTScore**: This metric evaluates the semantic similarity between the predicted and ground truth queries using contextual embeddings.\n\n   - **Limitations**: While BERTScore provides a more nuanced understanding of semantic similarity, it can still be affected by the quality of the embeddings and may not fully capture the correctness of the SQL logic.\n\n6. **Semantic Coherence**: This involves assessing how well the generated SQL aligns with the original natural language question, often using LLMs to evaluate coherence.\n\n   - **Limitations**: Semantic coherence does not directly measure the correctness of the SQL query itself and can be subjective based on the interpretation of the language model.\n\nOverall, while these metrics provide valuable insights into the performance of Text-to-SQL models, they each have limitations that can affect the evaluation's comprehensiveness. A combination of these metrics is often necessary to obtain a more holistic view of a model's capabilities.",

      "response_time": 16.063384532928467,
      "response": "The Spider and WikiSQL benchmarks differ significantly in terms of complexity and evaluation methodology.\n\n### Complexity\n1. **Spider**:\n   - Spider is recognized as a more complex benchmark, designed for cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL tasks. It includes over 10,000 natural language questions and SQL queries across 200 relational databases from 138 different domains.\n   - The SQL queries in Spider can involve multi-table queries (using JOINs), complex SQL clauses (like ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING), and nested SQL queries. This complexity makes it a challenging dataset for evaluating text-to-SQL systems.\n   - The queries are crafted to reflect a wide range of SQL functionalities, making it suitable for testing the robustness and adaptability of models in real-world scenarios.\n\n2. **WikiSQL**:\n   - In contrast, WikiSQL consists of simpler SQL queries that are primarily single-table and can be covered by straightforward query sketches. It contains around 80,000 question-SQL pairs derived from Wikipedia, but the complexity of the SQL queries is generally low.\n   - The simplicity of WikiSQL has led to high accuracy scores from current systems, but it is often criticized for not being representative of real-world applications due to its limited complexity.\n\n### Evaluation Methodology\n1. **Spider**:\n   - Evaluation in Spider typically involves metrics such as Execution Accuracy (EX) and Exact Matching (EM). EX measures whether the execution results of a predicted SQL query match those of a gold SQL query, while EM checks if the predicted query is syntactically identical to the gold query.\n   - Spider also has variants like Spider-Realistic, which removes explicit column names from natural language questions to better simulate real-world usage, and Spider-Syn, which tests robustness against synonyms.\n\n2. **WikiSQL**:\n   - WikiSQL's evaluation methodology is simpler, focusing on the accuracy of the generated SQL queries against the provided natural language questions. The evaluation is straightforward due to the simplicity of the queries involved.\n   - The benchmark is often used as a starting point for developing text-to-SQL systems, but it is acknowledged that it does not push the boundaries of what is possible in more complex scenarios.\n\nIn summary, Spider is a more challenging and comprehensive benchmark that tests a wider range of SQL capabilities, while WikiSQL is simpler and more limited in scope, making it less representative of real-world applications.\n\n### Sources:\n- Rajkumar_et_al__2022_Evaluating_the_Text_to_SQL_Capabilities_of_Large_L.pdf\n- Chang_and_Fosler_Lussier_2023_How_to_Prompt_LLMs_for_Text_to_SQL_A_Study_in_Zer.pdf\n- Katsogiannis_Meimarakis_and_Koutrika_2023_A_survey_on_deep_learning_approaches_for_text_to_S.pdf\n- Zhang_et_al__2024_Benchmarking_the_Text_to_SQL_Capability_of_Large_L.pdf",

      "expected_answer": "Spider is more complex than WikiSQL, featuring 10,000+ NLQs across 200 databases from 138 domains with multi-table queries and complex SQL clauses. WikiSQL is simpler with 80,000 question-SQL pairs focusing on single-table databases with less complex queries. For evaluation, Spider uses Execution Accuracy (EX) and Exact Matching (EM), and includes more challenging variants like Spider-Realistic. WikiSQL uses simpler evaluation focused on generated SQL accuracy but has been criticized for not reflecting real-world query complexity. Overall, Spider is more challenging and realistic for evaluating advanced text-to-SQL systems.",

(2022)**:\n   - The study evaluated various models, including Codex and GPT-3, on the Spider benchmark without any fine-tuning. \n   - Codex achieved an execution accuracy of up to 67% on the Spider development set.\n   - Performance metrics for different models were reported:\n     - **Finetuned Models**:\n       - T5-base: 72.7% valid SQL\n       - T5-large: 84.1% valid SQL\n       - T5-3B: 87.6% valid SQL\n       - T5-3B + PICARD: 97.8% valid SQL\n     - **Inference-only Models**:\n       - GPT-3 ada: 33.8% valid SQL\n       - Codex davinci: 91.6% valid SQL\n\n2. **Chang and Fosler-Lussier (2023)**:\n   - The paper discussed the impact of prompt construction on model performance in zero-shot and single-domain settings.\n   - It was found that with only 4 examples, the performance difference between models like Codex and ChatGPT diminished significantly, indicating that in-domain examples improve performance.\n   - The length of the prompt was also noted to significantly impact performance, especially in cross-domain settings.\n\n3. **Katsogiannis et al. (2023)**:\n   - The survey highlighted that while many models achieve high scores on benchmarks like Spider, they may not perform well on more complex datasets like SEDE, which reflects real-world SQL query complexity.\n   - It emphasized the importance of using task-specific pre-trained language models (PLMs) like TaBERT for better performance in text-to-SQL tasks compared to generic PLMs.\n\n4. **Zhang et al. (2024)**:\n   - This study proposed a new dataset and evaluation tasks to assess the performance of various LLMs across the Text-to-SQL process.\n   - It highlighted performance disparities among LLMs and suggested optimal in-context learning solutions tailored to specific tasks.\n   - The findings indicated that a more granular benchmarking approach is necessary to accurately reflect the multifaceted nature of Text-to-SQL tasks.\n\nOverall, the findings across these papers suggest that model performance varies significantly based on the type of model, the training approach (fine-tuning vs. zero-shot), and the prompt construction. Task-specific models tend to outperform general-purpose models, especially in complex scenarios.",
